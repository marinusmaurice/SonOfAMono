# SonOfAMono
The missing .Net Winforms IDE for Linux.
Please note. This is not necessarily the final name of the project. In fact .. EVERYTHING will change about project.
Its based on an old abandoned version of Sharpdevelop that no one loved ... except me.

# Son of a why???
In the week of the 17th/18th Oct 2021, the Monodevelop repo has been archived. Im not impressed at how it was abandoned.

# Ok, so whats the aims?
The aims of this project are amongst others: To provide a C# IDE for linux that 
    a) Allows one to do visual Winforms design and development on Linux
    b) Allows one to console development on Linux
    c) Compiles with Mono (unless .Net decides to wake up regarding winforms development on linux)

# What the project is not.
A competitor for Visual Studio, or whatever the monodevelop thing is called for Mac.
Its not the aim of the project to keep up with the Jone'ses.. e.g. Maui or whatever the latest fad in GUI dev is. (Just cos our neighbour got something flashy dont mean we have to have it.). We just want to do Winforms and Console dev on .net platform on linux. Anything else is a bonus.

# Whose in charge?
Me. (I have a TRUSTED second in charge).  The higher probability of success of anything requires a single entity to be in control. Its been proven over time. Don't question it.

# IMPORTANT
-License. Free for:
    all education facilities 
    broke developers 
    all who make meaningful contributions to the project in any way shape or form. (note.. fixing a spelling error doesnt necessarily count as meaningful .. unless its in the lexer/parser.. cmon.. you can figure it out).
-Business. Price we'll decide later. Dont worry. Price is whatever you can afford (may be subject to change).

# Why not GPL etc?
GPL takes one's freedom of choice from you. Read the licence PROPERLY if you don't believe me. 
Also. Licences like the above are more harmful for those who are unemployed, possibly broke and need to make a living using and (possibly) writing software that could depend on free and/or open source software. If you are unemployed, broke, no one wants to hire you.. then you will know EXACTLY what I mean.
For anything else Im sure sure GPL maybe has some use.

# Ok..Now we done with the boring stuff.. LETS SEE SOME PICS OF THE IDE ON LINUX!!!!
Sure. These are early EARLY day pics. Its still rife with bugs everywhere. But as soon as things are even compilable.. I will upload source. PROMISE!!

# Who am I?
Deadpool. Aka Maurice Marinus. Yes. I have a personality and life same like him. Unlike Deadpool, I'm actually good looking.
